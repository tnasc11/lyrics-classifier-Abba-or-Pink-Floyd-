You hate, you scream, you swear
And still you never reach them
You curse, you try to scare
But you can never teach them  
It's a dead end street
They've tied your hands and tied your feet
And the street is narrow
A nowhere lane, a nowhere train for Elaine, Elaine, Elaine  
Elaine, Elaine, Elaine, you know they're gonna get you
You try to break away, but they will never let you  
It's a dead end street
They've tied your hands and tied your feet
And the street is narrow
The nowhere lane, the nowhere train for Elaine, Elaine, Elaine
You're like a goldfish in a bowl, Elaine, Elaine, Elaine
They have your mind, they'll take your soul  
You come, you stay, you go, it really doesn't matter
You've done it all before, by now they know the pattern  

It's a dead end street
They've tied your hands and tied your feet
And the street is narrow
The nowhere lane, the nowhere train for Elaine, Elaine, Elaine

You're like a goldfish in a bowl, Elaine, Elaine, Elaine
They have your mind, they'll take your soul  
Björn  Know that you go, you know they're gonna get you
Know that you go, you know they'll never let you  

Agnetha, Frida  It's a dead end street
They've tied your hands and tied your feet
And the street is narrow
The nowhere lane, the nowhere train for Elaine, Elaine, Elaine

You're like a goldfish in a bowl, Elaine, Elaine, Elaine
They have your mind, they'll take your soul  
Björn  Know that you go, you know they're gonna get you
Know that you go, you know they'll never let you

Know that you go, you know they're gonna get you
