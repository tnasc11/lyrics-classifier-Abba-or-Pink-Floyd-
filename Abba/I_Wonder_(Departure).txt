This park and these houses, old streets I have walked
Everything dear, will it be here, one day when I am returning?
My friends will get married, have children and homes
It sounds so nice, well planned and wise, never expecting surprises

I wonder, it's frightening leaving now, is that the right thing?
I wonder, it scares me but who the Hell am I if I don't even try?
I'm not a coward oh no, I'll be strong
One chance in a lifetime yes I will take it, it can't go wrong

My friends and my family, this dull little town
Buses I've missed, boys that I've kissed
Everything old and familiar

I wonder, it's frightening leaving now, is that the right thing?
I wonder, it scares me but who the Hell am I if I don't even try?
I'm not a coward oh no, I'll be strong
One chance in a lifetime, yes I will take it, yes I will take it, it can't go wrong
