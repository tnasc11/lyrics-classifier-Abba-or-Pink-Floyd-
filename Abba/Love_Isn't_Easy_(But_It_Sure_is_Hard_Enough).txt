Do you remember the first time
And all of your sweet, sweet talk
Ain't heard a lot since then, love  

Now look at that guy
He's making me cry
He leaves every mornig
And he hardly says goodbye  

But if I would have to choose
I wouldn't let you go
Just give it some more time
And you will see your love will grow
Darling I know  

We gotta have patience, love isn't just a sensation
Some of the time it gets rough
Love isn't easy, but it sure is hard enough
(Sweet, sweet, our love is bittersweet)
Giving, love is the reason for living
But a few things can be tough
Love isn't easy, but it sure is hard enough
(Sweet, sweet, our love is bittersweet)  

From the first moment I saw you
I've treated you like a queen
I've given you lots of presents  

Now listen to that
Just look at a cat
You'd think he was an angel
But he's talking through his hat  

But if I would have to choose
I wouldn't let you go
Just give it some more time
And you will see your love will grow
Darling I know
