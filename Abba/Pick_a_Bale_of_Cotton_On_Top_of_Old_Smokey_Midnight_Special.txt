On Top Of Old Smokey

On top of old Smokey
All covered with snow
I lost my true lover
By courting so slow
For courting's a pleasure
And parting is brief
And a false-hearted lover
Is worse than a thief
On top of old Smokey
All covered with snow
I lost my true lover
By courting so slow

Midnight Special

Well, you wake up in the morning
Hear the ding dong ring
You go marching to the table
Wee the same old thing
See the fork on the table
Nothing in your pan
If you say a thing about it
You're in trouble with the man

Let the midnight special
Shine a light on me
Let the midnight special
Shine it's everlovin' light on me

If you ever go to Houston
Well you'd better act right
And you'd better not gamble
And you'd better not fight
For the sheriff will arrest you
And he'll take you down
And before you understand it
You are prison bound

Let the midnight special
Shine a light on me
Let the midnight special
Shine it's everlovin' light on me (on me, on me)
Let the midnight special
Shine a light on me
Let the midnight special
Shine it's everlovin' light on me (on me, on me)
