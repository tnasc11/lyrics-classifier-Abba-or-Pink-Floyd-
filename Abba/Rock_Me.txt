Rock me, give me that kick now
Rock me, show me that trick now
Roll me, you can do magic
Baby, and I can't get enough of it

Rock me, give me that feeling
Roll me, rocking and reeling
Baby, so don't stop doing it
Don't stop doing it, now

Don't stop the rocking
Don't stop the rocking
I said don't stop the rocking

Wanna be, wanna be
In my baby's arms
Gonna be gonna be

Nice and gentle if you want me to
Just as long as I'm in love with you
Yours forever, honey, that's what
I wanna be, wanna be, wanna be, yeah

Rock me, show me that trick now
Roll me, you can do magic
Baby, and I can't get enough of it
