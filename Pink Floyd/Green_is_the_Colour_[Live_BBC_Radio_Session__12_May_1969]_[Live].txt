Heavy hung the canopy of blue
Shade my eyes and I can see you
White was the light 
That shines through the dress that you wore

She lay in the shadow of a wave
Hazy were the visions overplayed
Sunshine in her eyes 
But moonshine made her cry everytime

Green is the colour of her kind
Quickness of the eye
Deceives the mind
Envy is the bond between
The hopefull and the damned
