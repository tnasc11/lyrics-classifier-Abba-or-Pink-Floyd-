Following the path as it leads towards
The darkness in the north
Weary strangers' faces show their sympathy
They've seen that hope before

But if you want to stay for a little bit
Rest your aching limbs for a little bit
Before you, the night is beckoning
And you know you can't delay
You hear the night birds calling you
But you can't catch the words they say
Close your ears and eyes, be on your way

Mist is swirling, creatures crawling
Hear the roar get louder in your ears
You know, the folly was your own
But the force behind can't conquer all your fears

And if you want to stay for a little bit
Rest your aching limbs for a little bit
Before you, the night is beckoning
And you know you can't delay
You hear the night birds calling you
But you can't catch the words they say
Close your ears and eyes, be on your way

Pull your thoughts back many years
To the time when there was life with every morning
Perhaps a day will come
When the light will be as clear as on that morning

And if you want to stay for a little bit
Rest your aching limbs for a little bit
Before you, the night is beckoning
And you know you can't delay
You hear the night birds calling you
But you can't catch the words they say
Close your ears and eyes, be on your way
